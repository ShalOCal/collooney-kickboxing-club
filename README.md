Collooney Kickboxing Club site is a site for people interested in kickboxing in and around the Collooney Co Sligo area. It caters to kids and adults alike and is a great source of exercise, fitness, self defence, fun and lasting friendships. It will be useful to parents interested in getting their kids into the sport as well as adults who would like to participate in the sport.

## Features ##

On this site we have the red and black colours associated with Collooney Kickboxing club with the header and navigation menu in red text with a black background througout all pages.
I used the Montserrat font as the "k" looks like a person kicking. I used unbounded also as I feel it flows well throughout the page.

The navigation links are fully responsive and will allow the user to easily navigate through the pages without the need to use the "back" button
We have a main image which jumps out at you when you open the site and this along with the page heading makes the site target audience very clear.
below this image on the main screen we have a Newsfeed which shows all the recent happenings and achievements in the club. This will show the target audience how well the club is doing and what they are achieving as motivation to join.

Beside this we have a video which shows a group of kickboxers practicing their kick light techniques.
below these items we have a gallery to show the acomplishments of the club and inspiration for anyone wishing to join.

Below the gallery we have the links to social media sites if the user wishes to continue to those sites
and below this we have a footer containing a repetition of the club logo.

The join us page contains a form requiring the persons name, email and phone number. When the details are entered this will currently take the inputter to a dummy page thanking them for their request to join.

The about us page contains information about the club and it's history.

## Future Implementations ##

In the future I would like to add a link to google maps. I should have done this in this edition but I didn't think of it until it was completed. 
I would also like to add a members area where they can log in and add their own content and converse with other members. 
Another idea would be an online booking system for classes where interested people could see what classes have spaces and they could book in and checkout straight away.

## Framework, Libraires, Programs and Languages used ##

In this project I used Git, Github, Google search.
Languages used were HTML and CSS

## Testing ##

I tested that the page works on both Google and Chrome browsers.
I tested responsiveness, look and function using devtools.
I have confirmed that the navigation buttons are easily readable.
I have confirmed that the join us form is functional, the button will not allow you to move on unless you fill the required fields and those fields will not accept information in an incorrect format, The clear form button works and clears the form.


## Bugs ##

When I deplayed my project I found that the social links did not work, I fixed this by deleting and replacing the links
In Firefox and in chrome on laptop the newsfeed box is splitting in 2 with the content only using approx 30% of the container, I have been unable to correct this.
On mobile I have been unable to get the video to move below the newsfeed box in order to give each more space.
